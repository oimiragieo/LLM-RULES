## ADR-087: Commands System Overhaul -- Thin Delegator Pattern + Command Catalog

**Date:** 2026-02-07

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**

17 command files exist in `.claude/commands/`. Only 3 properly delegate to skills (brainstorm, write-plan, execute-plan). 7 are thin stubs duplicating skill content. 4 reference dead infrastructure (`.claude/todos/`, `.claude/checkpoints.log`). 1 duplicates Router functionality. Documentation in `@DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md` falsely claims the directory was "Deleted (was empty)" on 2026-01-28. `CLAUDE.md` has zero references to commands.

**Decision:**

1. **Canonical pattern is thin delegator:** All commands that have a corresponding skill use the 3-line delegator pattern (`disable-model-invocation: true` + `Invoke the {skill} skill`).
2. **Delete 4 dead commands:** `/checkpoint` (dead infra), `/orchestrate` (redundant with Router), `/add-todo` (dead infra), `/check-todos` (dead infra).
3. **Convert 8 thin stubs** to proper skill delegators (build-fix, code-review, e2e, eval, refactor-clean, tdd, test-coverage, verify).
4. **Enrich `/learn`** to use memory protocol instead of dead `skills/learned/` directory.
5. **Add 4 new commands:** `/debug` (debugging), `/security-review` (security-architect), `/compress` (context-compressor), `/analyze` (project-analyzer).
6. **Create command catalog** at `.claude/context/artifacts/catalogs/command-catalog.md`.
7. **Fix documentation** in `@DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `router.md`, `capability-routing.json`, `GETTING_STARTED.md`.
8. **Commands remain NOT creator-guarded** (by design, per security review).

**Rationale:**

- Thin delegators make skills the single source of truth for behavior
- Dead infrastructure references confuse agents and waste context
- New commands surface existing high-value skills that users cannot easily discover
- Command catalog provides discoverability parallel to skill-catalog and template-catalog

**Consequences:**

- 17 commands become 17 (delete 4, add 4) with 100% functional
- All behavioral commands delegate to skills (single source of truth)
- Documentation accurately reflects reality
- Users can discover commands through the catalog

## ADR-085: Template System Overhaul -- Advisory Resolver + Dead Template Cleanup

**Date:** 2026-02-07

**Status:** Proposed

**Context:**

Audit of `.claude/templates/` found 43 template files with only ~20% actively integrated. The spawn prompt assembler (`spawn-prompt-assembler.cjs`) and core library (`prompt-assembler.cjs`) do not read spawn template files from disk -- they programmatically generate all required spawn prompt sections. 28 templates have zero references across the codebase. The template-creator skill references directories that do not exist. No template catalog file exists.

**Decision:**

1. **Spawn Template Resolver (advisory):** Create `.claude/lib/spawn/spawn-template-resolver.cjs` with `resolveSpawnTemplate(agentType, options)` that returns template metadata (name, path, reason). The resolver is advisory -- it helps the Router select the right template for guidance, but does not modify the critical-path spawn-prompt-assembler hook. Selection priority: explicit override > one-shot subordinate > orchestrator > identity frontmatter > universal default.

2. **Dead Template Cleanup:** Archive 14 templates to `.claude/templates/_archive/` (via `git mv`), delete 2 (html-css, general code-styles), keep and wire 12 valuable templates, upgrade 3 pending research input.

3. **Template Catalog:** Create `.claude/context/artifacts/catalogs/template-catalog.md` with structured entries for all ~27 active templates including agent assignments, categories, and usage instructions.

4. **Template-Creator Skill Fix:** Remove phantom directory references (hooks/, code/, schemas/), add missing categories (spawn, report, code-style), assign agents.

5. **Template README Update:** Add spawn templates section, report templates section, update code-styles list, add archive documentation.

**Alternatives Considered:**

1. **Template content injection:** Resolver loads template content and injects it into spawn prompts. Rejected -- would duplicate sections already handled by the assembler (AVAILABLE_TOOLS, Memory, etc.).
2. **Full template rendering engine:** Process `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` tokens programmatically. Rejected -- adds complexity without proportional value; current manual replacement is sufficient.
3. **Delete all dead templates:** Rejected -- some have genuine reference value. Archive preserves git history.

**Rationale:**

- Advisory resolver is lowest risk -- no changes to the critical spawn hook path
- Archive via `git mv` preserves full file history for restoration
- Markdown catalog is human-readable and agent-friendly (vs JSON registry)
- Wiring 12 templates increases active utilization from 20% to ~80%

**Consequences:**

- Template system goes from 20% to 80%+ utilization
- Router gains structured template selection guidance
- Template-creator skill becomes accurate (no phantom references)
- 14 templates archived (restorable), 2 deleted, 3 pending upgrade
- New catalog provides single source of truth for template discovery

## ADR-083: CI Hook Module-Resolution Checks (Hybrid Static + Dynamic)

**Date:** 2026-02-07

**Status:** Proposed

**Context:**

Commit 3487ee8b fixed three MODULE_NOT_FOUND crashes caused by hook library modules being accidentally archived during consolidation (Task #41). No mechanism exists to prevent this from recurring during future refactoring.

**Decision:**

Implement a hybrid hook verification script at `.claude/scripts/verify-hook-modules.cjs`:

1. **Static analysis (default):** Regex-based extraction of `require()` paths from all `.cjs` files in `.claude/hooks/` (excluding `_archive/`). Resolves relative paths against the filesystem. Reports missing modules.
2. **Dynamic verification (--deep flag):** Fork child processes to actually `require()` each hook with a 3-second timeout. Catches transitive dependency failures.
3. **settings.json cross-reference:** Verify every registered hook command in `settings.json` points to a file that exists on disk.

A supporting library at `.claude/lib/utils/require-analyzer.cjs` provides `extractRequires()` and `resolveRequirePath()`.

**Alternatives Considered:**

1. **Static-only:** Fast but cannot catch transitive or conditional requires. Chosen as default mode.
2. **Dynamic-only:** Comprehensive but some hooks read stdin or call process.exit(), causing hangs/crashes. Requires child process isolation with timeouts. Chosen as opt-in.
3. **AST parsing (acorn/babel):** More accurate than regex but adds npm dependencies. Rejected -- regex handles the literal-string require patterns used in all 39 active hooks.

**Rationale:**

- Static analysis covers 95%+ of cases (all hooks use literal string requires)
- Zero new npm dependencies (uses built-in `fs`, `path`, `child_process`)
- Fast enough for pre-commit (<500ms static, <15s dynamic)
- JSON output mode enables CI integration
- Cross-checks settings.json to catch "registered but deleted" hooks

**Consequences:**

- Future refactoring that moves/deletes hook libraries will be caught pre-commit
- CI pipeline can enforce hook integrity on every push
- False positives possible for dynamic requires (logged as warnings, not failures)

## ADR-084: Router Blacklist Violation Monitoring (Structured JSONL Tracking)

**Date:** 2026-02-07

**Status:** Proposed

**Context:**

The Router sometimes attempts to use blacklisted tools (Glob, Grep, etc.). The routing-guard.cjs hook catches these and either blocks or warns, but violations are logged as unstructured stderr output. There is no aggregation, no session-level counting, and no threshold alerting.

**Decision:**

Implement a violation tracking module at `.claude/lib/monitoring/violation-tracker.cjs`:

1. **Structured recording:** Each violation is a JSONL entry in `.claude/context/metrics/router-violations.jsonl` with timestamp, tool, action, check name, router mode, and session ID.
2. **Rotation:** Max 1000 lines with tail-trim rotation (reuses `appendJsonl` from `jsonl-utils.cjs`).
3. **Threshold alerting:** `checkThreshold()` function detects >N violations in a time window and emits a one-time warning per routing-guard invocation.
4. **Integration:** Lazy-loaded into `routing-guard.cjs` with graceful degradation if module is missing.

**Alternatives Considered:**

1. **Extend error-tracker.cjs:** Rejected -- error-tracker is for runtime errors, not policy violations. Mixing concerns would complicate analysis.
2. **Standalone hook:** Rejected -- would require additional settings.json registration and duplicate routing-guard's violation detection logic.
3. **In-memory only (no file):** Rejected -- each hook invocation is a separate process, so in-memory state does not persist across tool uses.

**Rationale:**

- JSONL format is append-friendly and matches existing metrics patterns (error-metrics.jsonl, hook-metrics.jsonl)
- Lazy loading ensures routing-guard.cjs is not broken if violation-tracker is missing
- Threshold alerting provides early warning of systematic Router misbehavior
- Separate metrics file enables independent analysis of routing policy compliance

**Consequences:**

- Router violations become visible and analyzable over time
- Threshold warnings surface systematic issues early
- Adds ~1ms overhead per violation (sync file append)
- New `.claude/lib/monitoring/` directory establishes monitoring library pattern

## ADR-082: Hook Hardening -- Restore Archived Monitoring Modules + Fix Router-State Path

**Date:** 2026-02-06

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**

Three hook modules are MISSING at their expected paths, causing MODULE_NOT_FOUND crashes on every hook invocation:

1. `error-tracker.cjs` -- required by `error-tracker-hook.cjs` (PostToolUse), archived but not replaced
2. `metrics-collector.cjs` -- required by `metrics-collector-hook.cjs` (PostToolUse), archived but not replaced
3. `router-state.cjs` -- required by `user-prompt-unified.cjs` (UserPromptSubmit) at OLD path; module was relocated to `lib/routing/` but this one consumer was not updated

Root cause: Hook consolidation (Task #41, commit 0e449681) archived 45 orphan hooks and relocated router-state.cjs. The two monitoring library modules were mistakenly archived even though their wrapper hooks (registered in settings.json) still require them. One consumer of router-state.cjs was missed during the path update.

**Decision:**

1. Restore `error-tracker.cjs` from `_archive/monitoring/` to `hooks/monitoring/` (exact copy)
2. Restore `metrics-collector.cjs` from `_archive/monitoring/` to `hooks/monitoring/` (exact copy)
3. Fix `user-prompt-unified.cjs` line 71: change `routingRequire('router-state.cjs')` to `libRequire(path.join('routing', 'router-state.cjs'))`

**Rationale:**

- Restoring archived code is lower risk than writing new implementations
- Archived modules have proper rate limiting, validation, error handling, and match the exact interface expected by the wrapper hooks
- The router-state path fix follows the pattern already used by all other hooks in the routing directory
- No new dependencies, no test changes needed

**Consequences:**

- Error tracking and metrics collection restored on every PostToolUse event
- Router mode reset restored on every UserPromptSubmit event (routing analysis functional)
- Future hook consolidation efforts must verify wrapper hooks do not reference archived libraries

## ADR-078: Workspace Conventions and Directory Reorganization

**Date:** 2026-02-06

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
Deep audit (Task #19) found 55+ misplaced files in `.claude/context/artifacts/` root, no naming convention, no provenance tracking, and inconsistent report placement. Research (Task #20) identified industry best practices for agent workspace organization.

**Decision:**

1. Establish `.claude/rules/workspace-conventions.md` as the canonical workspace rules file
2. Create new directory structure: `reports/{domain}/`, `artifacts/{analysis,catalogs,summaries,database}/`
3. Adopt kebab-case naming with ISO 8601 date suffixes: `{name}-{YYYY-MM-DD}.{ext}`
4. Require provenance headers on all generated files: `<!-- Agent: {type} | Task: #{id} | Session: {date} -->`
5. Move `spawn-size-audit.jsonl` to `metrics/`, `rule-index-cache.json` to `config/`
6. Keep `evolution-state.json`, `reflection-queue.jsonl`, and `agent-registry.json` at context root (35+ cross-cutting references each)
7. Inject workspace conventions into the spawn template so all agents know the rules

**Rationale:**

- Flat structure (Option A) chosen over nested because it is simpler and easier to enforce
- Files with deep cross-cutting references (evolution-state.json has 35+ refs in hooks, workflows, agents) are too risky to move; pragmatic decision to document as canonical
- Provenance headers enable traceability without complex metadata systems
- Rules placed in `.claude/rules/` which Claude Code auto-loads as project instructions

**Consequences:**

- All new agent-generated files will follow naming and placement conventions
- Spawn template instructs every agent on correct file locations
- Legacy files in `artifacts/` root remain for now (Task #22 handles migration)
- Three root-level context files documented as canonical exceptions

## ADR-079: Agent Utilization Remediation Strategy

**Date:** 2026-02-06

**Status:** Proposed (pending implementation)

**Context:**
Audit (Task #35) found that 94% of agents (46/49) have never been spawned. The Router collapses all requests to `developer` because enforcement hooks default to `warn` and no post-completion workflow chain exists.

**Decision:**
Implement a 4-phase remediation strategy:

1. **Phase 1 (Immediate):** Change enforcement defaults to `block` mode for `PLANNER_FIRST_ENFORCEMENT` and `SECURITY_REVIEW_ENFORCEMENT`. This forces the Router to spawn planner for complex tasks and security-architect for security-sensitive tasks.

2. **Phase 2 (Short-term):** Create a PostToolUse hook on TaskUpdate(completed) that triggers follow-up agent spawns: code-reviewer for implementation tasks, qa for code changes, technical-writer for documentation changes, and reflection-agent for all completions.

3. **Phase 3 (Medium-term):** Fix the reflection deadlock by making Step 0 either spawn reflection-agent automatically or make reflections asynchronous. Implement a workflow state machine in `.claude/context/runtime/workflow-state.json`.

4. **Phase 4 (Long-term):** Add Router intent-to-agent enforcement that prevents spawning `developer` when the classified intent maps to a different agent.

**Rationale:**
- Phase 1 is zero-code (env var changes) and immediately activates planner + security-architect
- Phase 2 activates 5 more agents (code-reviewer, qa, technical-writer, reflection-agent, architect)
- Phase 3 fixes the reflection/learning loop
- Phase 4 prevents regression to developer-only routing

**Consequences:**
- Agent spawn costs will increase (more agents = more API calls)
- Task completion will take longer (multi-phase review)
- Quality and security will significantly improve
- The multi-agent architecture will finally be utilized as designed

## ADR-080: Enterprise Orchestration Workflow State Machine

**Date:** 2026-02-06

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
Agent utilization audit (Task #35, ADR-079) established that 94% of agents are never spawned. The Router collapses all requests to `developer` due to: (1) enforcement hooks defaulting to `warn`, (2) no post-completion workflow chain, (3) no workflow state machine, and (4) no phase-based execution model. Research (Task #36) identified that LangGraph-style state machines with CrewAI-style role-based teams and quality gates between phases represent industry best practices for enterprise multi-agent orchestration in 2026.

**Decision:**
Implement a 7-phase enterprise orchestration workflow state machine that the Router MUST follow for every request:

1. **Phase 0: TRIAGE** -- Router classifies request (intent, complexity, domain, risk) and determines phase path
2. **Phase 0.5: DYNAMIC CREATION** -- When capability gap detected, create missing agents/skills via EVOLVE workflow
3. **Phase 1: DESIGN** -- Parallel spawn of planner + architect + security-architect (varies by complexity)
4. **Phase 2: IMPLEMENT** -- Developer + domain specialist following the plan from Phase 1
5. **Phase 3: REVIEW** -- Parallel spawn of code-reviewer + qa + security-architect
6. **Phase 4: DEPLOY** -- DevOps agent: lint, format, commit, push, CI verification
7. **Phase 5: DOCUMENT** -- Technical-writer updates docs, README, CHANGELOG
8. **Phase 6: REFLECT** -- Reflection-agent extracts learnings and updates memory

Key architectural decisions within this ADR:

- **Complexity-based phase skipping:** TRIVIAL tasks skip to Phase 2+4 only; LOW adds Phase 1+3; MEDIUM adds Phase 5; HIGH runs all phases; EPIC adds orchestrator coordination
- **Persistent state in workflow-state.json:** Router reads this file every turn to know which phase to advance to. Survives context resets.
- **Quality gates between every phase:** Blocking checks prevent advancement; non-blocking checks generate warnings
- **Post-completion chain hook:** PostToolUse on TaskUpdate(completed) automatically triggers next phase advancement
- **Enforcement hooks in block mode by default:** `PLANNER_FIRST_ENFORCEMENT=block`, `SECURITY_REVIEW_ENFORCEMENT=block`, `SPAWN_PROMPT_VALIDATOR=block`
- **Intent-to-agent enforcement:** New hook prevents spawning `developer` when classified intent maps to a different agent
- **Agent handoff via artifacts + TaskUpdate metadata:** Agents communicate through files at workspace-convention-compliant paths plus structured metadata in TaskUpdate calls

**Alternatives Considered:**

1. **Keep current ad-hoc routing (status quo):** Rejected. 94% agent under-utilization makes the multi-agent architecture pointless. No quality gates, no post-implementation review.
2. **Full LangGraph runtime integration:** Rejected. Would require a Python runtime and external dependency. The existing Task/TaskUpdate infrastructure provides equivalent state management capability.
3. **CrewAI-only approach (role-based, no state machine):** Rejected. CrewAI crews lack quality gates between phases. State machine ensures each phase completes before the next begins.
4. **Event-driven architecture (pub/sub between agents):** Rejected for now. The file-based blackboard pattern (workflow-state.json + artifact files) is simpler and works within Claude Code's single-conversation model. Event-driven could be added later as an optimization.

**Rationale:**

- The hybrid approach (LangGraph state machine + CrewAI role-based teams) combines the strengths of both frameworks
- File-based state (workflow-state.json) survives context resets -- critical for long-running workflows
- Quality gates enforce multi-agent collaboration rather than making it optional
- Complexity-based phase skipping prevents overhead for simple tasks (TRIVIAL tasks still get just developer + devops)
- The design uses ONLY existing infrastructure (Task, TaskUpdate, TaskList, file system) -- no new external dependencies
- Block-mode enforcement is the single highest-impact change: it immediately forces the Router to use planner and security-architect

**Consequences:**

- **Positive:** Agent utilization increases from 2% to 24%+ (12 unique agent types activated)
- **Positive:** Every code change gets at least one independent review (code-reviewer, qa, or security-architect)
- **Positive:** Architectural decisions are captured in design documents before implementation
- **Positive:** Memory system (learnings, decisions, issues) is actively maintained by reflection-agent
- **Positive:** Workflow state survives interruptions -- no lost progress on context reset
- **Negative:** API costs increase (3-10 agents per request vs 1 today)
- **Negative:** Task completion time increases (multi-phase review adds latency)
- **Negative:** Router complexity increases (must manage state machine transitions)
- **Mitigated:** Complexity-based skipping keeps simple tasks fast (TRIVIAL: 2 agents, 1-2 turns)

**Implementation Plan:** `.claude/context/plans/enterprise-orchestration-plan-2026-02-06.md`
**Workflow Document:** `.claude/workflows/core/enterprise-workflow.md`
**Depends On:** ADR-079 (Agent Utilization Remediation Strategy)
