## ADR-2026-03-12-065: Multi-Model Review Must Run in Fresh Session (2026-03-12)

**Status:** ACCEPTED (pattern)
**Date:** 2026-03-12
**Trigger:** Task 5 Phase 3 multi-model review (Gemini/Codex) blocked by 24 context-length-exceeded errors after long Phases 1 and 2.
**Decision:** Multi-model review phases that follow heavy analysis+implementation sequences MUST run as the first phase of a fresh session. The EPIC pipeline plan template must include an explicit "Fresh Session Gate" checkpoint before multi-model review steps. "Start review in fresh session" must appear in the handoff note of the preceding implementation task.
**Consequences:** Adds an explicit session boundary in EPIC pipelines. Slightly extends wall-clock time but prevents review phase from being silently dropped due to context overflow.

## ADR-2026-03-12-064: Security Audit Confirms shell:false Compliance Baseline (2026-03-12)

**Status:** ACCEPTED (observation)
**Date:** 2026-03-12
**Trigger:** Security audit of all active `.claude/hooks/` files (65 files scanned).
**Decision:** All 65 production hook files are shell:false compliant. The one `shell:true` instance in `tools/cron-runner/queue-drain.cjs` is documented-intentional (non-hook tool, trusted internal command). This establishes a verified compliance baseline as of 2026-03-11. Track any new hook additions against this baseline via CI.
**Consequences:** shell:false baseline confirmed. Future hook authors must not use `shell:true` in production hook code. The cron-runner exception must be unit-tested to assert `writebackCmd` is assembled from hardcoded parts only.

## ADR-2026-03-01-063: Python/DevOps orphaned skill wiring batch (2026-03-01)

**Status:** ACCEPTED
**Date:** 2026-03-01
**Trigger:** Orphaned skill sweep -- 5 skills (modern-python, poetry-rye-dependency-management, pyqt6-ui-development-rules, powershell-expert, feature-flag-management) had no agent-skill-matrix entries and defaulted to developer/Other.
**Decision:** Wire each skill to domain-appropriate agents via agent-skill-matrix.json AND agent frontmatter. modern-python primary to python-pro; poetry-rye and pyqt6 secondary/contextual to python-pro; powershell to developer+devops; feature-flags to developer+devops+qa. Update CATEGORY_MAP in generate-skill-index-definitions.cjs for correct index classification.
**Alternatives:** Could have created dedicated domain agents for each, but skills are cross-cutting and fit better as augmentations to existing agents.
**Consequences:** 5 fewer orphaned catalog skills. python-pro now has comprehensive Python tooling coverage. devops gains PowerShell and feature-flag capabilities.

## ADR-2026-02-23-062: stale-module-pruner and proactive-audit skill-updater pass (2026-02-23)

**Status:** ACCEPTED
**Date:** 2026-02-23
**Trigger:** User requested skill-updater on stale-module-pruner and proactive-audit.

**Decision:** (1) stale-module-pruner: rewrote stub SKILL.md to v1.0.0 with real workflow (ripgrep-based dead code crawl, dry-run gate, prune report), 5 Iron Laws, 5 Anti-Patterns, Memory Protocol, 6 mandatory skills. Fixed catalog: added to Quick Reference Core Development row (16→17) since parseMarkdownTable() only reads first table. Added developer to agent assignments. (2) proactive-audit: upgraded v1.1.0→v1.2.0, added Mandatory Skills table (6 skills), updated lastVerifiedAt. Both pass validate-integration.

## ADR-125: lsp-navigator P2 Gap in Non-Code-Primary Agents (2026-03-12)

**Status:** Accepted
**Decision:** `lsp-navigator` skill is NOT required for ops/infra/research-focused agents (researcher, ecosystem-auditor, devops, reverse-engineer, database-architect, performance-engineer, sre-engineer, incident-responder, chaos-engineer). It is a P2 enhancement for these 9 agents, not a P0/P1 compliance requirement.
**Rationale:** These agents' primary workflows do not require compiler-level symbol navigation. LSP is most valuable for agents doing deep code authoring or refactoring (developer, code-reviewer, architect, qa, code-simplifier, security-architect, typescript-pro, etc.). Forcing lsp-navigator on ops/infra agents adds noise to their skills list without functional benefit.
**Evidence:** Agent wiring compliance audit 2026-03-11 — all 18 code-work agents that do need LSP already have it. The 9 agents missing it have ops/infra/research primary workflows.
**Next action:** Add lsp-navigator to these 9 agents in next agent update cycle (non-urgent).

## ADR-2026-03-12-066: Extend drain gate to include reflection queue check

**Date:** 2026-03-12
**Status:** Decided

**Problem:** Reflections queued during a pipeline (via TaskUpdate post-tool hooks) are not caught until the next UserPromptSubmit, because Step 0 only fires on new user messages. Router writes deliverable before reflections are processed.

**Decision:** The Completion Reporting drain gate (CLAUDE.md Section 2) must include a reflection queue check as step 3:

1. TaskList() → zero tasks
2. Read reflection-spawn-request.json → if entries > 0, spawn reflection-agents BEFORE writing deliverable
3. Only then write the completion summary

**Why not a per-prompt validator:** Expensive (fires on every response). The drain gate check is free — it only costs 1 file read at natural pipeline completion points, not on every single router response.

**Implementation needed:**

- Update CLAUDE.md "Completion Reporting (Drain Gate)" section
- Update router-decision.md Step drain gate
- No hook changes needed — infrastructure already works correctly

**Root cause of 2026-03-12 incident:** Drain gate only checked TaskList(), not reflection queue. 5 reflections left unprocessed until next UserPromptSubmit.
