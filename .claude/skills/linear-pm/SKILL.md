## Security

- Never expose LINEAR_API_KEY in logs or output
- API key should have minimal required permissions
- All tools that modify data require confirmation

## Error Handling

1. Verify API Key: Check LINEAR_API_KEY is set correctly
2. Check API Rate Limits: GraphQL 1500 requests/hour; REST 500 requests/hour
3. Validate Query Syntax: Ensure GraphQL queries are well-formed
4. Check Team/Issue IDs: Verify IDs exist and are accessible

## Agent Integration

- planner: Project management and backlog prioritization
- developer: Issue tracking during development

## Common Workflows

### Sprint Planning

1. current-cycle - Get current sprint
2. list-issues --state Backlog - Get backlog items
3. update-issue --cycle-id ... - Assign issues to sprint

### Issue Triage

1. list-issues --state Backlog - Get unplanned issues
2. set-priority --issue-id ... --priority 2 - Set priority
3. add-label --issue-id ... --label bug - Categorize

### Project Tracking

1. list-projects --team-id ... - Get all projects
2. project-issues --project-id ... - Get project issues
3. cycle-progress --cycle-id ... - Check sprint progress

## Iron Laws

1. **ALWAYS** verify `LINEAR_API_KEY` is set before any API call — Linear's API returns a 401 with a generic error message when the key is missing or expired; early validation produces a clear, actionable error.
2. **NEVER** create duplicate issues without first searching by title — Linear doesn't deduplicate issues automatically; running the skill twice without a search creates duplicate work items that confuse team tracking.
3. **ALWAYS** use issue state IDs (not state names) when transitioning issues — state names are case-sensitive, locale-dependent, and change when teams rename states; IDs are stable.
4. **NEVER** fetch all team issues without a filter — unbounded team queries return thousands of issues, exhaust the API rate limit, and produce unusable context dumps.
5. **ALWAYS** cache team and project metadata within a session — team IDs and project keys don't change during a session; re-fetching on every operation wastes API quota and slows workflows.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern                                    | Why It Fails                                                     | Correct Approach                                                                         |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Creating issues without deduplication check     | Duplicate issues split tracking; team velocity metrics skewed    | Search with a title filter (`issues` query with `filter.title.eq` field) before creating |
| Using state names in transitions                | Case-sensitive; breaks when team renames state; locale issues    | Use `workflowState { id }` query to get stable IDs; transition by ID                     |
| Fetching all team issues without filter         | Thousands of results; rate limit hit; unusable output            | Filter by `state`, `assignee`, `cycle`, or `label` in GraphQL query                      |
| Re-fetching team/project metadata per operation | Multiple identical API calls; rate limit waste; slow execution   | Fetch team and project IDs once at session start; reuse for all subsequent calls         |
| Ignoring pagination cursors                     | Only first page returned; missed issues cause incomplete reports | Use `pageInfo { hasNextPage, endCursor }` and paginate until `hasNextPage: false`        |

## Memory Protocol (MANDATORY)

**Before starting:**
Read .claude/context/memory/learnings.md

**After completing:**

- New pattern -> .claude/context/memory/learnings.md
- Issue found -> .claude/context/memory/issues.md
- Decision made -> .claude/context/memory/decisions.md
